Please note the code is not digitally signed, thus you might need to suppress warnings issued by e.g. SmartScreen in order to run the application.

In addition, a few antivirus programs incorrectly flag this software as malware. Local User and Group Management may cause problems if used carelessly, but it is not malicious. If you prefer to not trust binaries, feel free to read the source code and compile it using [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com).
